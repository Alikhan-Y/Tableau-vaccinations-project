# Tableau-vaccinations-project
## Info 
This project aimed at utilizing avaliable vaccinations dataset from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases, and further visualizing it using Tableau tools. 
## Guideliens 
The dataset is saved in vaccinations-data.csv or can be obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases.
The data has been divided and visualized into 6 blocks:
- Partially vaccinated people (recieved only 1 jab) 
- Fully vaccinated people (recieved all reccomended doses to be considered as fully vaccinated) 
- Share of not vaccinated over the total population
- Partially vs Fully Vaccinated per Location
- Partially Vaccinated per Hundred worldwide
- Partially Vaccinated over GDP (to see whether high GDP correlates with the share of partially vaccinated people)

All 4 filters are selectable:
- Continent 
- Country
- Start Date 
- End Date

Finished dashboard avaliable in Vaccinations-dashboard.twbx.
